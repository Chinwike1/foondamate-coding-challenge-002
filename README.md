## Description
_________________________
This repository is my solution to the FoondaMate Software Engineer Coding Challenge-002. This program was built using Node.js with [InquireJS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer) for the CLI and [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) for testing.

**Objective**
- Write an application (web,CLI, or any other type)
- This application should solve equations like:
`7x - 2 = 21` and `2(4x + 3) + 6 = 24 -4x`

- And returns a solution like with all the steps needed to solve the equation
- Write unit and integration tests for your code


## Usage
_________________________
To run this program, you'll need to have installed **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org) v16.8 or above**.

First, clone the repository:
```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Chinwike1/foondamate-coding-challenge-002.git
```

Then move into the project
```bash
cd foondamate-coding-challenge-002
``` 

And install the project dependencies
```bash
npm install
```
Start the program with:

```bash
npm run start
```

## Testing and Edge cases
_________________________


```bash
